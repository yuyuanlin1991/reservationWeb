    Goal
</h2>
<p class="com-text-content">
    Westlake Fellows seek exceptional young scientists of great promise in their early careers whom we wish to attract
    to Westlake, on occasion leading to subsequent faculty appointments. We will provide them the opportunity to start
    their own research with independence or semi-independence, pursue cutting-edge research, and with access to the
    outstanding technical and scientific resources at Westlake for three years as an alternative to traditional
    post-doctoral programs. The appointment can be extended due to actual needs for up to three additional years for a
    total of six years. Meanwhile, they can benefit from the mentorship of their host faculty with tremendous
    flexibility and the full support from the host School and the University. Approximately eight to ten Fellowships are
    awarded each year.&nbsp;
